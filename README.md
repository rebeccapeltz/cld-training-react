# Upload, Transform, Deliver with Cloudinary React SDK

This project uses Sandpack to provide in app code sandboxes.  You can modify and run the code in each Sandbox. 

## Upload Widget

You need to create an unsigned preset in order to use the Upload Widget in the Front End.  Cloudinary presets provide instructions that are executed during the upload.  The purpose of the unsigned preset is to allow for an upload in the Front End without having to expose your Cloud's API SECRET.  In the sandox code for this course, you will enter you upload preset name and cloud name to authorize the upload.

In order to create your unsigned preset, you will need to be be able to login to the cloud specified by the cloud name and go to the Upload Settings page.   If you haven't created an unsigned preset before, you'll need to click the link that authorizes creation of unsigned presets.  Once click, it will provide a statement that "Unsigned presets are enabled".  

The authorization provided by the unsigned preset allows you to code and configure an Upload Widget on a web page without using the API SECRET which is used for backend uploads.  On the backend you can hide the API SECRET from your user.  Note that when you are using an unsigned preset, it is a good idea to require authentication and authorization to the web page that renders the Upload Widget.  This will prevent unwanted access to uploading to your cloud.
